ALE contributes to the following language workbenches:

* [Melange](http://melange.inria.fr/)
* [The GEMOC Studio](http://gemoc.org/studio)
* [Rascal](http://www.rascal-mpl.org/)

ALE researchers also initiated the development of the [ALE language](http://gemoc.org/ale-lang/), an <em>Action Language for EMF</em> that allows to “re-open” the EClasses from Ecore metamodels to implement existing EOperations and weave new features or new operations. 

NEWS: The ALE language is going to be contributed to the Eclipse project [Ecore tools](https://www.eclipse.org/ecoretools/).
